# Equal Experts Calculator

The calculator has been built with Create React App.

In order to start the calculator app, first install all dependencies:
```
$ npm i
```

And then use the npm `start` script:
```
$ npm start
```

To the the calculator you will need to run the `test` script:
```
$ npm test
```

## Notes
* Only the 'add' function works currently
* Other operations have been commented out for now
* As other operations are added, the code can probably be abstracted a little bit more
* Only supports basic addition e.g. x + x = z
* No continuation when pressing `=`
