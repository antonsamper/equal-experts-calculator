# Equal Experts Calculator

The calculator has been built with Create React App. In order to start the app, first install all dependencies:
```
$ npm i
```

And then use the npm `start` script:
```
$ npm start
```

To test the calculator you will need to run the `test` script:
```
$ npm test
```
If you see a message saying *No tests found related to files changed since last commit.*, then just press the letter `a` and that will run all the test suites.


## Notes
* Only the 'add' function works
* Other operations have been disabled out for now
* When other operations are added, the code can probably be abstracted a little bit more
* Only supports basic addition e.g. `x + x = z` or `x + x + = y`
* No continuation when pressing `=` multiple times
